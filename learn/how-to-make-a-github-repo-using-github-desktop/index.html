    <p>Welcome to Cheespeasa's coding tutorials. In this article you will learn how to make a GitHub repository using
        GitHub Desktop. This will be necessary later on in order to make your website go online. GitHub repositories can
        help you organize things and allows for collaboration on another level.</p>

    <p>But first, what even is a Github repository?</p>

    <p>A GitHub repository is an online copy of a set of files. Whenever you make a change, and then "push" those
        changes, that online copy gets updated. If your friend wants to help, he simply must "fork" your repository, and
        then he will have his own copy to work with. Additionally, if you grant access, that friend will be able to
        update the online copy. This allows for greater collaboration.</p>

    <p>
        The other reason that we are going to use GitHub repositories is that they allow us to host a website for free,
        using GitHub's servers.
    </p>

    <h2>Step One</h2>
    <h2>Making the Repository</h2>
    <p>
        First of all, you must <a href="https://github.com/join">Signup</a> for GitHub. Once you have done that, you
        will encounter a screen that prompts you to make a new repository. It should look like this:
    </p>
    <img src="img/mainpage.png" width="720" height="380">
    <p>
        Then, press the "Create repository" button. It would look like this:
    </p>
    <img src="img/createrepo.png">
    <p>
        Now, you must follow the next steps carefully:
    <ol>
        <li>Set the name of your repository to your username + ".github.io". It MUST be spelled the exact same way. For
            example, my repository name would be "CheespeasaTutorial.github.io". If it is done incorrectly, your site
            will not work!</li>
        <li>Set the repository to public.</li>
        <li>Do not make a README.md. We do not need it.</li>
        <li>And lastly, press "Create Repository".</li>
    </ol>
    </p>

    <h2>Step Two</h2>
    <h2>Importing the Repository</h2>

    <p>
        When you are ready, <a href="https://desktop.github.com">download GitHub desktop</a> for your machine.
    </p>

    <p>
        Once it is installed, skip the tutorial, or view it. It is up to you. You now need to clone the repository onto
        your machine.
    </p>

    <p>
        At the top bar, there is a tab called "File". It will look like this: <img src="img/topbar.png"> Click "File".
        Then click "Clone Repository", like so:
    </p>

    <img src="img/file.png"> <img src="img/file-clone.png">

    <p>
        In this new menu, you must do the following.
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li></li>
    </ol>
