        <div class="entry">
            Morning. Can't sleep so I might as well make an entry. On this page (and soon this whole site) I am changing spans to divs. This should make the code more redundant and readable. Also, a short story.
            <br>
            For my Hebrew school classes bar/bat mitzvahs, our parents got to make a ~4*5 inch "card" for us. It went in like, a yearbook type of book. Most families just made a card with a baby photo and "wErE so ProUD oF YoU bAbY yOu grEW uP sO FAst". However, my MADLAD mom went out of her way to LEARN HTML, and wrote a script (THAT WORKS) to display the card. And the card had the script on it, and below it, the image and stuff! 
            <br> 
            It's so cool that coding has become accessible enough that my mom learned enough HTML to display images and text at the same time, and make it look good with a font. I can't even do images, lol.
            <br>
            Anyway, punnet square progress. I tried making some progress but the thing kept breaking. I am going to try again soon but just know that I am still working on it.
            <br>
            That's pretty much it, so to whoever is reading this, have a good day.

            Hello gamers. Thomas fixed all the broken links. thanks. So I can't figure out what to do for the next project. I might do a punnet square calculator. That will be interesting. Also, I reorganized this page, so newer articles are at the top. Not much else really, so have a good day.

        <div class="titlet">WordleGen fixed, pme++ updooted, blog went bye bye</div><br>
        <hr>
        <div class="entry">
            Hello from Aruba! I am currently in bed in a hotel on Aruba. Pretty cool. Did I mention I'm in Aruba? Anyway, I wanted to talk about my journey to fix the WordleGen and why it broke, and also why im a dumbass for not figuring it out.
            <br>
            So I attempted to implement date input and not days input like originally. It works well now, but originally, I thought that the <i>input</i> tag set to Date input would return a Date object, but it actually returns the millisecond value. I then had to convert that to a date and add hours to it and then I could pass it into the generator. It works now but it was broken for a while. I have to email my grandparents and tell them it works again.
            <br>
            Additionally, now, I realized this file is called index.hmtl again. I don't know when I renamed it to that, but whatever. Now onto the PME++ interpreter.
            <br>
            I decided that I am going to drop the project mainly because I'm not very inspired to do it anymore. However I do kind of want to make a new "compression" system. One of the main file size culprits right now is the WordleGen, because the <i>script</i> tag in the file has to list every single word choice in a row. So maybe, I could figure out how to get the string value of an html file, and then nav to a js file, and then turn that into code for html files. I wanted to do this because sometimes, New York Times adds new words to the roster and that means I have to fix everything. Kinda annoying. But it's fine. Maybe instead, I could make a program to make an array smaller, then decompress it for use in the js. 
            <br>
            Also, blog has gone bye bye. I don't want to upkeep it, it's a pain in the ass to maintain, (not like I've been maintaining it anyway) but yeah. I think my site will be better off without it.
            <br>
            Anyway, just a few things about Aruba. Food ain't bad, weather is SOOOO hot, like way too hot, and I have a cold. However we do have a lot of stuff planned so that should be cool. 
            <br>
            I may in the future actually remove all personal details on this site so that I can advertise it on Twitter and GitHub. That would be cool. I say <i>that would be cool</i> a bit too much, don't you think?
            <br>
            Anyway, have a good day everyone. Peace.

            So I removed the file name from the url up top! If you look at the url, now it says /blog, not /blog/index.html.
            Very proud of that. Also, what I did with wordle might be illegal. I don't really care though. Also, I kind of
            erased all of the curse word from the site. Just in case. Hello Mr Zeller
            <br>
            Yesterday, I presented the pong game I made. I am going to see if chrome still supports applets. I don't think
            they do, so I'm going to try to find a way to upload the pong game I made to this site. It's really cool, and it
            features Walter White.
            <br>
            I added an about me page now. I put my email. Please don't email me unless it's important, that is legitimately
            my only email account that I can use, please don't blow it up. Who am I kidding, no one reads this. I added some
            of my achievements onto that page. Now that I'm thinking about that, I really haven't done much. Hopefully this
            site helps.
            <br>
            I don't know what next project to start on here. My current project has been written entirely in Java and I
            don't know how to make Java go on a site. But I will return with more information on that.
            <br>
            Lastly, I wanted to add some information on my current workflow. Right now, I do pretty much everything for this
            website in vscode and then drag and drop in into the file manager and then it works. I might even buy premium to
            make this faster but then I'd need to generate a return from this site. However, I can't do that. Because then
            I'd be making money off of Wordle, nytimes' creation. That's illegal. I don't really care but I don't like the
            idea of a conglomerate megacorporation having it out for me. Although my allowance might cover it?
            <br>
            Thats it.
            <br>
            Have a good day gamers

        <div class="entry">
            This is the first entry. IDK what to put here. I might put a blog. After all, I did name this file blogtest.html . I
            kind of have an obligation now. Maybe it will be a coding blog.
        <br>
            So lets start, then? I figured out subpages just now. Funny, cause my previous website didn't use those. Turns out it's just as easy as making subfolders. Next task, getting rid of the "something.html" on the nav. I want it to look clean. Lets see if I can figure that out. I also want to make an icon and a title in the tab. That would be cool.
        <br>
            Today, I have:
            <ol>
                <li>Made a subpage</li>
                <li>Made a hub</li>
                <li>Made this site</li>
                <li>Fallen asleep during class</li>
            </ol>
            I know. Very productive. The goal of this, btw, is not to flex my skill, but just to flex my non-skill. I'm pretty bad at this, so I just want to see how far I can get before I die. Pretty cool. Alright goodbye
