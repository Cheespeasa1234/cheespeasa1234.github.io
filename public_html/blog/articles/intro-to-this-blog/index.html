        <h1>Welcome to this blog</h1>
        <h2>By Nate Levison, March 28 2022</h2>

        <p>So, this is going to be a blog. I will post some of my thoughts on recent events, not like annoying things though. When an event really is important to me I will write about my view on it.</p>
        <br>
        <p>As always, you can email me (email is at the <a href="../../../aboutme">About Me</a> page) to let me know about what you think. Feedback is always appreciated.</p>
