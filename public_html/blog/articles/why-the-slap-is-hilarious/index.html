        <h1>Why the Will Smith slap is a blatant PR stunt- and if not, a joke</h1>
        <h2>By Nate Levison, March 31 2022</h2>

        <p>The memes coming from Will Smith slapping Rock are hilarious. It is crazy to see a huge quantity of memes being created, high quality ones too, from a minor event that happened only 3 days ago.</p>

        <p>But the unseen amount of interest in this event is exactly why I am so interested in it. I recently read some of a book about people who manipulate the media. They are paid to plan events and controversy, which then increases either sales or interest in a product. The product here isn't really evident- it's probably just clout.</p>

        <p>The fact that Will Smith, of all people, decided to do such an act on the Grammy's to someone while the world was watching is enough evidence just to prove that Smith is benefiting from this event.</p>

        <p>According to Google Trends, which keeps track of searches and how popular they are, searches for Will Smith, Chris Rock, and "Slap" have gone up insanely fast, reaching 100 points. (out of 100, points rate how close to the highest ever a search term has been- in this case, Will Smith's searches have NEVER been higher.)</p>

        <p>And look at all of these related search terms.</p>

        <p>If you aren't already convinced, notice how Smith yelled "Keep my wife's name, out of your f***ing mouth!" TWICE. One, off camera, two, on camera, clearly, and easily to hear. I'm disturbed by how close people feel to people who have no cares for them. I hope that some people still remember that celebrities only are celebrities because they make money. </p>

        <p>I hope you learned something from this. Remember to check out some of my other articles if you want to. Have a good day.</p>
